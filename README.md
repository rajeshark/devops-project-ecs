1. Project Overview

QuickCart is a full-stack e-commerce application deployed on AWS using modern DevOps practices.

Key Features:
The frontend is fully serverless (hosted on S3 + CloudFront), and backend microservices run on AWS Fargate, so no server management is required

Microservices architecture with 6 backend services: auth, product, cart, order, payment, email

Backend built with Node.js and connected to PostgreSQL RDS

Frontend built with React.js: includes customer website and admin dashboard

Frontend hosted on S3 with CloudFront CDN for fast delivery

Backend services deployed on ECS Fargate with ALB for routing

CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Terraform

Docker images stored in AWS ECR

Domain name attached via Route 53

3. CI/CD Pipeline

Workflow:

Build Stage (Jenkins)
1.1 Pull backend (Node.js) code from GitHub.
1.2 Build Docker images for all backend microservices (auth, product, cart, order, payment, email).
1.3 Pull frontend (React.js) code from GitHub.
1.4 Build React frontend app.

Push Stage
2.1 Push backend Docker images to AWS ECR.
2.2 Deploy frontend build to S3 bucket.

Deploy Stage (Terraform)
3.1 Deploy ECS Fargate services with updated Docker images.
3.2 Configure ALB with path-based routing for APIs.
3.3 Deploy CloudFront + S3 for frontend.
3.4 Provision Security Groups, IAM roles, and RDS PostgreSQL.

End Result
4.1 Frontend served via CloudFront + S3.
4.2 Backend services running on ECS Fargate, accessible via ALB.
4.3 Automatic deployment ensures any code push updates the application seamlessly.

Security                               	IAM Roles, Security Groups, VPC,subnets,nat

5. Security & Networking

Explain how your AWS setup ensures security:

VPC: Private subnets for ECS tasks and RDS.

Security Groups: Restrict inbound/outbound traffic.

IAM Roles: ECS tasks use roles to access AWS resources securely.

HTTPS: Enabled via CloudFront and ALB for frontend and API.

Database Security: PostgreSQL RDS only accessible from ECS services

6. How the Application Works (Flow)

Step-by-step end-to-end flow for users:

User accesses frontend website (customer or admin).

Frontend requests go through CloudFront CDN → S3 bucket.

API requests are routed via ALB.

ALB forwards requests to the appropriate ECS Fargate service based on path.

Microservices interact with PostgreSQL RDS to read/write data.

Responses are returned to frontend via ALB → CloudFront → User.

7. Future Enhancements / Learnings

Implement autoscaling for ECS services.

Add monitoring & logging with CloudWatch or ELK stack.

Modularize Terraform scripts for reusability.

Improve CI/CD pipeline with automated tests.

Ah! I see the issue — the numbering in section 8 (Deployment Architecture) isn’t copying properly. This usually happens if you use nested numbers or bullets inconsistently. The fix is to use **simple sequential numbering** without sub-decimal points, which works perfectly in Word, Google Docs, or Markdown. Here’s section 8 rewritten cleanly:

---

### **8. Deployment Architecture / Infrastructure Details**

1. **Frontend Deployment**

   * React app is built and uploaded to **S3** via Jenkins CI/CD.
   * **CloudFront CDN** serves content globally.
   * Custom domain configured using **Route 53**.

2. **Backend Deployment**

   * Node.js microservices are containerized with **Docker**.
   * Docker images pushed to **AWS ECR**.
   * **ECS Fargate** launches tasks using these images.
   * **ALB** routes API requests to the appropriate service based on URL paths.

3. **Database Deployment**

   * **PostgreSQL RDS** stores all application data.
   * Hosted in **private subnets** for security.
   * Only ECS services can access it via **Security Groups**.

4. **CI/CD Integration**

   * Jenkins automates build and deployment of frontend and backend.
   * Terraform provisions and updates all AWS infrastructure (ECS, ALB, S3, CloudFront, RDS, IAM, Security Groups).

5. **Security & Networking**

   * VPC with private/public subnets.
   * IAM roles for ECS tasks and Jenkins deployment.
   * Security Groups control traffic between ECS, ALB, and RDS.
   * HTTPS enforced via CloudFront and ALB.
     

Perfect! Here’s a **clean, copy-paste-friendly summary section** with proper numbering:
